🔐 Authentication System with Flask & Flask-Login
A complete authentication system built with Flask and Flask-Login to handle user sessions, login, and security. This implementation highlights my understanding of web frameworks and security best practices.

✨ Key Features:
Flask & Flask-Login – Secure, session-based authentication with role management.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) – Enhanced security with time-based authentication using PyOTP, ensuring an extra layer of protection for user accounts.
User Experience Design – Focused on an intuitive UX with CSS enhancements, smooth animations, and interactive feedback (success/failure messages).
PyOTP Integration – Seamlessly integrated PyOTP for generating time-based tokens, demonstrating my ability to utilize third-party libraries for added functionality.
This project demonstrates my ability to build secure, user-friendly web applications while focusing on both backend security and frontend experience. 🚀
